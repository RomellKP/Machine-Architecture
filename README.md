Projects for Machine Architecture:

Project 1: 

  Description: Two seprate implementations: a hashmap and stock class. Implemented following hashmap functions for operating on hashmaps: _init,
  _put, _get, _free_table, _show_structure, _write_items, _save, _load, next_prime, and _expand. Implemented the following functions to use and 
  display stock data found in the data folder: stock_print, stock_new, stock_free, stock_set_hilo, stock_set_best, count_lines, stock_load, and
  stock_plot.

  Run and Compile: For hashmap problem compile and run hashmap_main.c and for stock problem compile and run stock_main.c. From there, follow 
  directions in terminal and type out commands. 

  My Contributions: hashmap_funcs.c, stock_funcs.c

Project 2:

  Description:Implemented a thermo display controller that reads temperature sensor data and updates a digital display. Optimized for embedded
  systems as it uses minimal CPU and memory footprint. This is achieved through integer operations no dynamic memory allocation. Implemented the
  following funtions: thermo_update, set_temp_from_ports, and set_display_from_temp.

  Run and Compile: Run and compile thermo_main.c. From there, follow directions in terminal and type out commands.

  My Contributions: thermo_update.c
